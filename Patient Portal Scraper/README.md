# Patient Portal Webscraping Algorithm

## Project Description
The Patient Portal Web Scraping Tool is a Python algorithm designed to identify websites following the format https://[ID].portal.athenahealth.com/. The algorithm systematically explores various numerical variations of the ID in the URL and extracts pertinent information, specifically the practice name, from each website. The common structure of the websites includes a welcome message in the form "Welcome to the [Practice Name] patient portal."

The primary objective of the algorithm is to automate the extraction process, allowing for efficient collection of URLs and corresponding practice names. The extracted data is then organized and stored in an Excel file for easy reference and analysis.

## Steps
1. **Verify and Identify Title Format:** Perform an initial assessment to verify and identify the format of the title for each provided URL.
2. **Explore Numerical Variations:** Utilize the Python algorithm to systematically explore various numerical variations of the ID in the URL.
3. **Extract Practice Names:** Implement the algorithm to extract practice names from the "Welcome to the [Practice Name] patient portal" message on each site.
4. **Compile and Organize Data:** Compile and organize the extracted data into an Excel file for convenient storage and analysis.
