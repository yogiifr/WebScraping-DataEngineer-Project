## Project Description
This project involves the development of a specialized tool for scraping and downloading images from a designated website, specifically [https://www.pngmart.com/](https://www.pngmart.com/). The objective is to retrieve all images in PNG format to curate a dataset tailored for machine learning purposes. The extracted dataset will be utilized for training and enhancing machine learning models.

## Steps
1. **Verify and Identify Title Format:** Perform an initial assessment to verify and identify the format of the title for each provided URL.
2. **Explore Numerical Variations:** Utilize the Python algorithm to systematically explore various numerical variations of the ID in the URL.
3. **Extract Practice Names:** Implement the algorithm to extract practice names from the "Welcome to the [Practice Name] patient portal" message on each site.
4. **Compile and Organize Data:** Compile and organize the extracted data into an Excel file for convenient storage and analysis.
